# Hospital-Emergency-Dashboard
"Emergency Room data: tracks patients' demographics, admission time, anonymized ID/name, referral department, admission status, wait time, satisfaction score, and case manager assignment."

Patient ID
A unique alphanumeric code assigned to each patient, serving as the main identifier for record tracking and data privacy. Ensures individual cases are distinguishable and confidential.

Patient Admission Date
The specific date and, if recorded, time when the patient was admitted to the emergency room. Used to analyze admission volumes, identify rush periods, examine seasonal patterns, and assess ER responsiveness.

Patient First Initial
The first letter of the patient's first name. This field assists in anonymization and regulatory compliance (HIPAA, GDPR), allowing demographic grouping without direct identification.

Patient Last Name
The patient's last name (possibly anonymized in line with privacy requirements). Allows for grouping or trend analysis by family or cultural background while maintaining confidentiality.

Patient Gender
The gender identity of the patient (Male, Female, Other/Nonbinary). Used for demographic breakdowns and to study gender-related disparities or trends in emergency care utilization.

Patient Age
The patient's age at the time of ER admission. Enables analysis by age group, helping identify which populations access emergency care most frequently and for which reasons.

Patient Race
Self-reported race or ethnic identity of the patient. Vital for assessing healthcare equity, monitoring outcomes, and exploring disparities in emergency room access and care among different groups.

Department Referral
Indicates the hospital department (e.g., Cardiology, Orthopedics, Pediatrics) to which the patient was referred from the ER. Key for analyzing patient flow and resource needs across specialties.

Patient Admin Flag
A boolean field indicating whether the patient was formally admitted after the ER visit.

True: Patient admitted for further hospital care (inpatient/ICU/specialty ward).

False: Patient not admitted—discharged, referred to another facility, or treated as an outpatient.

Patient Satisfaction Score
Numerical measure (e.g., 1–5, 1–10) of the patient’s assessment of their ER experience. High scores indicate satisfaction; low scores reveal areas needing improvement. Central for monitoring and improving service quality.

Patient Wait Time
Measures the elapsed time between patient arrival and first medical attention in the ER. A critical operational metric, it supports analyses of efficiency, bottlenecks, and patient experience.

Patients CM (Case Manager)
Identifies the staff member or team coordinating the patient's ER care episode. Useful for evaluating case management effectiveness, workload distribution, and post-care outcomes.
